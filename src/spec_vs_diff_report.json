  "summary": "Frontend implements bilingual UI with language toggle, explore/list/detail pages, filters, and a new-recipe form using React Query hooks. Backend defines a Recipe model and basic CRUD-like queries, but seeding/persistence/search requirements are only partially met, and static asset requirements are not evidenced in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes methods to create, list, get-by-id, and search/filter recipes (including search by text).",
      "reason": "Backend includes addRecipe, getRecipe, getAllRecipes, and simple cuisine/category filtering methods, but no text search method is implemented (and no combined search/filter API is evident).",

        "backend/main.mo"

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Recipe records persist across page refreshes/canister calls during runtime and are returned consistently by list/get APIs.",
      "reason": "The recipe store and nextRecipeId are defined as non-stable variables (no stable storage shown), and there is no upgrade/state preservation logic; additionally, seeding is only called in postupgrade, not at initial deployment.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "A fresh deploy includes a non-empty recipe list without requiring any user input.",
      "reason": "seedRecipes() is only invoked in system func postupgrade(), so initial deployment would not seed data unless an upgrade occurs.",

      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Seeded recipes cover at least 3 categories and at least 3 cuisines, and each has a photoAssetPath that resolves to an actual frontend static asset under the generated assets folder.",
      "reason": "Only one seeded recipe is shown, and its photoAssetPath points to \"/static/images/recipes/carbonara.jpg\" rather than a frontend generated asset path (e.g., /assets/generated/...). No additional seeded recipes are present in the diff.",

      "reason": "UI references generated assets paths, but no added image files under frontend/public/assets/generated are shown in the diff summary (some files were omitted due to limits, so existence cannot be confirmed from provided evidence).",
